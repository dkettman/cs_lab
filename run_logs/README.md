# Run Logs!
Here you will find example run logs for each box. This is just to give you an idea of what output you will see and is considered "normal" for this process. There is a lot of weirdly formatted output because Chef is calling DSC resources, and in calling them, they are outputting DSC stylized output. Check the 'output.txt' file for that output. It is just a huge wall, but is individually the data from each box's build.
